## Installation
To install the tool globally, use npm:

```bash
npm  install  -g  db-migrate-cli
```
This will make the `db-cli` command available globally on your system, allowing you to run migration commands from anywhere.


## Usage

### <a id="quick-start"></a> 🚀 Quick Start
Get up and running with `db-migrate-cli` in just a few simple steps! Here's how you can manage your database migrations like a pro.

#### **1. Setup Your Migration Configuration**
Kickstart your migration process by setting up the configuration file.

```bash
db-cli  setup
```

- 📝 This creates the `config/migration.js` file in your project.
- 🔧 Customize the `migrationDir` and your database settings in this file.

**Example:**
```bash
# Setting up the migration configuration
db-cli setup

# Output:
# Configuration file created at config/migration.js
```
#### **2. Initialize Migration Infrastructure**
Prepare your database for migrations by setting up the necessary tables and procedures.

```bash
db-cli  migrate:init
```

- 🚀 This creates a `db_migrations` table in your configured database.
- ⚙️ Also sets up essential stored procedures to manage your migrations.

**Example:**
```bash
# Initializing the migration infrastructure
db-cli migrate:init

# Output:
# Migration infrastructure initialized. 'db_migrations' table created.
# Procedures 'addMigration', 'deleteMigration', 'executeQuery', 'getLastBatchMigrations', and 'getMigrations' created.
```

#### **3. Create Your First Migration**
Ready to make some changes? Create a new migration file with your desired changes.

```bash
db-cli  make:migration <migration_name>
```

- 📁 The file is stored in the directory specified by `migrationDir`.
- ⏰ The file name includes a timestamp and is in snake case.

**Example:**
```bash
# Creating a new migration file
db-cli make:migration create_users_table

# Output:
# Migration file created: migrations/2024_08_09_13_59_01_create_users_table.sql
```

**Example Migration File:**
```sql
-- migrations/2024_08_09_13_59_01_create_users_table.sql

-- UP
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    age INT
);

-- DOWN
DROP TABLE users;
```
This migration file contains the SQL commands necessary to create a `users` table in the database. The `-- UP` section includes the SQL to apply the changes, and the `-- DOWN` section provides the SQL to undo them.

#### **4. Apply Migrations**
Time to execute your changes! Run all pending migrations to update your database.

```bash
db-cli  migrate
```

- ✅ This applies all the migrations that haven't been executed yet.

**Example:**
```bash
# Applying all pending migrations
db-cli migrate

# Output:
# Migrating: 2024_08_09_13_59_01_create_users_table
# Migrated: 2024_08_09_13_59_01_create_users_table
```
#### **5. Rollback Changes**
Made a mistake? No problem! Rollback the last batch of changes.

```bash
db-cli  rollback
```

- ⏪ This undoes the last set of migrations applied.

**Example:**
```bash
# Rolling back the last batch migrations
db-cli rollback

# Output:
# Rollback: 2024_08_09_13_59_01_create_users_table
```
### Commands
#### `setup`
Initializes the migration configuration by creating the `config/migration.js` file in the current working directory. Configure the `migrationDir` and database settings in this file after running the command.
```bash
db-cli  setup
```
#### `migrate:init`
Sets up the migration infrastructure by creating the `db_migrations` table in your configured database and establishing the necessary stored procedures.
```bash
db-cli  migrate:init
```
#### `make:migration`
Generates a new migration file within the `migrationDir` specified in `config/migration.js`. The file name includes a timestamp and the provided name, converted to snake case.
```bash
db-cli  make:migration <migration_name>
```
#### `migrate`
Executes all pending migrations, applying them to the configured database.
```bash
db-cli  migrate
```
#### `rollback`
Reverts the most recent batch of migrations, undoing the last changes applied.
```bash
db-cli  rollback
```

## Configuration

After running `db-cli setup`, you will have a `config/migration.js` file in your project. You'll need to edit this file to specify your migration directory and database connection settings. Here's how:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  migrationDir: 'migrations',  // Directory where migration files are stored

  // Database connection settings
  db: {
    host: 'localhost',         // Database host
    user: 'root',              // Database user
    password: 'password',      // Database password
    database: 'my_database',   // Database name
    port: 3306                 // (Optional) Default is 3306
  }
};
```
### Configuration Options:

-   **`migrationDir`**: The directory where your migration files will be stored. This is where new migration files created with `db-cli make:migration` will be saved.
    
-   **`db` Object**: Contains your database connection settings:
    
    -   **`host`**: The hostname of your database server.
    -   **`user`**: The username used to connect to the database.
    -   **`password`**: The password associated with the database user.
    -   **`database`**: The name of the database where migrations will be applied.
    -   **`port`**: (Optional) The port on which your database server is listening. Defaults to `3306` for MySQL/MariaDB.
